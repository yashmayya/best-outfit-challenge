# best-outfit-challenge
This is a prototype web app built for the Myntra-Jabong Hackerramp 2019 using Flask. 

# Idea

Increase daily user engagement through gamification by introducing a new contest- Best Outfit Challenge- that will run every 3 days.

# Overview

* The contest proposed is a mix of both luck and skill.
* Essentially, users will be provided with a set of shirts/tops, trousers/jeans/skirts/shorts and footwear.
* First, users must decide whether they want to submit for male/female category. This is the luck aspect of the challenge.
* The users must pick out one piece of clothing from the sets mentioned and form an outfit that they believe to be fashionable. This is the skill aspect of the challenge.
* Finally, an in-house fashion expert will assemble the outfit they believe to be most fashionable, from the given clothing for one of the male/female categories, which will be chosen at random.
* Users whose submitted outfits match the model outfit created by the expert will be adjudged winners of the contest. They will be rewarded with coupons for the pieces of clothing they selected.

# Key Considerations

* The process of assembling an outfit should not take more than 3-4 minutes. Hence, an optimal size of the set is required, which is large enough to allow plenty of possibilities but also small enough so users don't lose interest during selection.
* All clothing belonging to same category i.e Shirt must not be too divergent in pricing/branding. This is because exclusive pieces of clothing are accepted to be fashionable and that could make the contest easy to crack.
* All clothing belonging to same category i.e Shirt must be aesthetically different. Having a set with five white shirts is not a good idea.
* The implementation should be extendable to allow more categories i.e watches/purses in the future.
